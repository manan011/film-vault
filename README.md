# Film Vault - IMDB Clone

A web application built with React.js (using Vite for fast development) that aims to replicate some of the core features of the IMDB website. Users can explore a list of movies fetched from the TMDB API, add movies to a personal watchlist, and manage their selections.

## Features

* **Movies Page:** Displays a paginated list of movies fetched from the TMDB API. Includes movie banners and individual movie cards.
* **Pagination:** Footer navigation to browse through multiple pages of movies, displaying the current page and total number of pages.
* **Movie Cards:** Each card shows basic movie information and features an "Add to Watchlist" button.
* **Watchlist Page:** A dedicated page accessible through routing where users can view movies added to their watchlist in a table format.
* **Watchlist Table:** Displays movie poster, title, rating, popularity, genre, and a "Delete" button for each movie.
* **Add/Remove from Watchlist:** Clicking "Add to Watchlist" on a movie card adds it to the watchlist and changes the button to "Remove from Watchlist." Clicking "Remove from Watchlist" (on either the movies page or watchlist page) removes the movie.
* **Local Storage Persistence:** The watchlist data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the watchlist persists across sessions.
* **Search Functionality:** A search bar on the watchlist page allows users to filter movies in their watchlist by title.
* **Genre Filtering:** Dynamic genre buttons appear above the watchlist, populated based on the genres of movies added to the watchlist. Clicking a genre button filters the watchlist to show only movies of that genre.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and lean development experience for modern web projects.
* **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests (to fetch movie data from TMDB).
* **TMDB API:** The Movie Database API used to retrieve movie information.
* **React Router:** A library for implementing routing and navigation within the React application.
* **Local Storage:** Browser-based storage for persisting the user's watchlist data.
